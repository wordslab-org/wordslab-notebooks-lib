    "\n",
    "The model can use an the text editor tool to view and modify text files, helping you debug, fix, and improve your code or other text documents. This allows the model to directly interact with your files, providing hands-on assistance rather than just suggesting changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use the text editor tool**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of when to use the text editor tool are:\n",
    "- Code debugging: Have the model identify and fix bugs in your code, from syntax errors to logic issues.\n",
    "- Code refactoring: Let the model improve your code structure, readability, and performance through targeted edits.\n",
    "- Documentation generation: Ask the model to add docstrings, comments, or README files to your codebase.\n",
    "- Test creation: Have the model create unit tests for your code based on its understanding of the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use the text editor tool**\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide the text editor tool (named `str_replace_based_edit_tool`) to the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can optionally specify a `max_characters` parameter to control truncation when viewing large files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The text editor tool can be used in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Provide the model with the text editor tool and a user prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "- Include the text editor tool in your API call\n",
    "- Provide a user prompt that may require examining or modifying files, such as \"Can you fix the syntax error in my code?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2 The model uses the tool to examine files or directories\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model assesses what it needs to look at and uses the view command to examine file contents or list directory contents\n",
    "- The model response will contain a tool use request with the view command\n",
    "\n",
    "3 Execute the view command and return results\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extract the file or directory path from the model's tool use request\n",
    "- Read the file's contents or list the directory contents\n",
    "- If a max_characters parameter was specified in the tool configuration, truncate the file contents to that length\n",
    "- Return the results to the model by continuing the conversation with a new user message containing a tool result\n",
    "\n",
    "4 The model uses the tool to modify files\n",
    "\n",
    "- After examining the file or directory, the model may use a command such as str_replace to make changes or insert to add text at a specific line number.\n",
    "- If the model uses the str_replace command, it constructs a properly formatted tool use request with the old text and new text to replace it with\n",
    "\n",
    "5 Execute the edit and return results\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extract the file path, old text, and new text from the model's tool use request\n",
    "- Perform the text replacement in the file\n",
    "- Return the results to the model\n",
    "\n",
    "6 The model provides its analysis and explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- After examining and possibly editing the files, the model provides a complete explanation of what it found and what changes it made\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text editor tool commands**\n",

    "The text editor tool supports several commands for viewing and modifying files:\n",
    "\n",
    "**view**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `view` command allows the model to examine the contents of a file or list the contents of a directory. It can read the entire file or a specific range of lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "- command: Must be \"view\"\n",
    "- path: The path to the file or directory to view\n",
    "- view_range (optional): An array of two integers specifying the start and end line numbers to view. Line numbers are 1-indexed, and -1 for the end line means read to the end of the file. This parameter only applies when viewing files, not directories.\n",

    "**Handle errors**\n",
    "\n",
    "File not found\n",

    "\n",
    "The bash tool enables the model to execute shell commands in a persistent bash session, allowing system operations, script execution, and command-line automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The bash tool provides the model with:\n",
    "- Persistent bash session that maintains state\n",
    "- Ability to run any shell command\n",
    "- Access to environment variables and working directory\n",
    "- Command chaining and scripting capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Development workflows: Run build commands, tests, and development tools\n",
    "- System automation: Execute scripts, manage files, automate tasks\n",
    "- Data processing: Process files, run analysis scripts, manage datasets\n",
    "- Environment setup: Install packages, configure environments\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works**\n",
    "\n",
    "The bash tool maintains a persistent session:\n",
    "1. the model determines what command to run\n",
    "2. you execute the command in a bash shell\n",
    "3. reurn the output (stdout and stderr) to the model\n",
    "4. session state persists between commands (environment variables, working directory)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter |\tRequired | Description\n",
    "-- | -- | --\n",
    "`command` | Yes* | The bash command to run\n",
    "`restart` | No | Set to true to restart the bash session\n",
    "\n",
    "*Required unless using `restart`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Multi-step automation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model can chain commands to complete complex tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# User request\n",
    "\"Install the requests library and create a simple Python script that fetches a joke from an API, then run it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Model tool calls:\n",
    "# 1. Install package\n",
    "{\"command\": \"pip install requests\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Create script\n",
    "{\"command\": \"cat > fetch_joke.py << 'EOF'\\nimport requests\\nresponse = requests.get('https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke')\\njoke = response.json()\\nprint(f\\\"Setup: {joke['setup']}\\\")\\nprint(f\\\"Punchline: {joke['punchline']}\\\")\\nEOF\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Run script\n",
    "{\"command\": \"python fetch_joke.py\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The session maintains state between commands, so files created in step 2 are available in step 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Handle errors**\n",
    "\n",
    "Command execution timeout\n",
    "- If a command takes too long to execute: \"Error: Command timed out after 30 seconds\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Command not found\n",

    "\n",
    "Permission denied\n",
    "- If there are permission issues: \"bash: /root/sensitive-file: Permission denied\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation best practices**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use command timeouts: Implement timeouts to prevent hanging commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintain session state: Keep the bash session persistent to maintain environment variables and working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handle large outputs: Truncate very large outputs to prevent token limit issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log all commands: Keep an audit trail of executed commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sanitize outputs: Remove sensitive information from command outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security**\n",
    "\n",
    "The bash tool provides direct system access. Implement these essential safety measures:\n",
    "- Running in isolated environments (Docker/VM)\n",
    "- Implementing command filtering and allowlists\n",
    "- Setting resource limits (CPU, memory, disk)\n",
    "- Logging all executed commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Key recommendations\n",
    "- Use ulimit to set resource constraints\n",
    "- Filter dangerous commands (sudo, rm -rf, etc.)\n",
    "- Run with minimal user permissions\n",
    "- Monitor and log all command execution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common patterns**\n",
    "\n",
    "Development workflows\n",
    "- Running tests: pytest && coverage report\n",

    "- Git operations: git status && git add . && git commit -m \"message\"\n",
    "\n",
    "File operations\n",
    "- Processing data: wc -l *.csv && ls -lh *.csv\n",
    "- Searching files: find . -name \"*.py\" | xargs grep \"pattern\"\n",
    "- Creating backups: tar -czf backup.tar.gz ./data\n",
    "\n",
    "System tasks\n",
    "- Checking resources: df -h && free -m\n",
    "- Process management: ps aux | grep python\n",
    "- Environment setup: export PATH=PATH:/new/path && echo PATH\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- No interactive commands: Cannot handle vim, less, or password prompts\n",
    "- No GUI applications: Command-line only\n",
    "- Session scope: Persists within conversation, lost between API calls\n",
    "- Output limits: Large outputs may be truncated\n",
    "- No streaming: Results returned after completion\n",
    "\n",

    "To minimize exfiltration risks, the model should not be allowed to dynamically construct URLs. The system should only fetch URLs that have been explicitly provided by the user or that come from previous web search or web fetch results. However, there is still residual risk that should be carefully considered when using this tool.\n",
