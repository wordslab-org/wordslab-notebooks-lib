    "\n",
    "## Built-in Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. read_file\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Read a UTF-8 file, returning content from a specific line range.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Signature**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ReadFileArgs(BaseModel):\n",
    "    path: str\n",
    "    offset: int = 0  # Line number to start reading from (0-indexed, inclusive)\n",

    "    lines_read: int\n",
    "    was_truncated: bool = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Mechanisms**:\n",
    "1. **Path Validation**:\n",
    "   - Expands user home directory (`~`)\n",
    "   - Resolves relative paths to absolute\n",
    "   - Validates path exists and is a file (not directory)\n",
    "   - Checks path is within project directory using `path.relative_to(Path.cwd().resolve())`\n",
    "   - Raises `ToolError` with security message if path is outside project\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Size Limits**:\n",
    "   - Configurable `max_read_bytes` (default: 64,000 bytes)\n",
    "   - Tracks bytes read and stops at limit\n",
    "   - Sets `was_truncated` flag in result\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Allowlist/Denylist**:\n",
    "   - Uses `fnmatch` for pattern matching\n",
    "   - Checks file path against configured patterns\n",
    "   - Returns `ToolPermission.ALWAYS` or `ToolPermission.NEVER`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - Catches `OSError` and wraps in `ToolError`\n",
    "   - Validates input parameters (empty path, negative offset, invalid limit)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **State Tracking**:\n",
    "   - Maintains history of recently read files (max 10)\n",
    "   - Helps prevent infinite loops\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt**: \n",

    "\n",
    "- By default, it reads from the beginning of the file.\n",
    "- Use `offset` (line number) and `limit` (number of lines) to read specific parts or chunks of a file. This is efficient for exploring large files.\n",
    "- The result includes `was_truncated: true` if the file content was cut short due to size limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy for large files:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Call `read_file` with a `limit` (e.g., 1000 lines) to get the start of the file.\n",
    "2. If `was_truncated` is true, you know the file is large.\n",
    "3. To read the next chunk, call `read_file` again with an `offset`. For example, `offset=1000, limit=1000`.\n",

    "   - Validates path is within project directory\n",
    "   - Raises `ToolError` if path is outside project\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Overwrite Protection**:\n",
    "   - Default `overwrite=False` prevents accidental overwrites\n",
    "   - Explicit `overwrite=True` required to replace existing files\n",
    "   - Validates file existence before writing\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Size Limits**:\n",
    "   - Configurable `max_write_bytes` (default: 64,000 bytes)\n",
    "   - Rejects content exceeding limit\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Directory Creation**:\n",
    "   - Configurable `create_parent_dirs` (default: True)\n",
    "   - Creates parent directories if enabled\n",
    "   - Validates parent directory exists if disabled\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Allowlist/Denylist**:\n",
    "   - Uses `fnmatch` for pattern matching\n",
    "   - Checks file path against configured patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - Validates non-empty path\n",
    "   - Catches `OSError` and wraps in `ToolError`\n",
    "   - Validates content size before writing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt**: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Use `write_file` to write content to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Arguments:**\n",
    "- `path`: The file path (relative or absolute)\n",
    "- `content`: The content to write to the file\n",
    "- `overwrite`: Must be set to `true` to overwrite an existing file (default: `false`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT SAFETY RULES:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- By default, the tool will **fail if the file already exists** to prevent accidental data loss\n",
    "- To **overwrite** an existing file, you **MUST** set `overwrite: true`\n",
    "- To **create a new file**, just provide the `path` and `content` (overwrite defaults to false)\n",
    "- If parent directories don't exist, they will be created automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "**BEST PRACTICES:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ALWAYS** use the `read_file` tool first before overwriting an existing file to understand its current contents\n",
    "- **ALWAYS** prefer using `search_replace` to edit existing files rather than overwriting them completely\n",
    "- **NEVER** write new files unless explicitly required - prefer modifying existing files\n",
    "- **NEVER** proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files unless explicitly requested\n",
    "- **AVOID** using emojis in file content unless the user explicitly requests them\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "``python\n",
    "# Create a new file (will error if file exists)\n",
    "write_file(\n",
    "    path=\"src/new_module.py\",\n",
    "    content=\"def hello():\\n    return 'Hello World'\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overwrite an existing file (must read it first!)\n",
    "# First: read_file(path=\"src/existing.py\")\n",
    "# Then:\n",
    "write_file(\n",
    "    path=\"src/existing.py\",\n",
    "    content=\"# Updated content\\ndef new_function():\\n    pass\",\n",
    "    overwrite=True\n",
    ")\n",
    "``\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:** For editing existing files, prefer `search_replace` over `write_file` to preserve unchanged portions and avoid accidental data loss.\n",

    "- Tasks that provide no organizational benefit\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Management Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Status Management:**\n",
    "   - Only ONE task should be `in_progress` at a time\n",
    "   - Mark tasks `in_progress` BEFORE starting work on them\n",
    "   - Mark tasks `completed` IMMEDIATELY after finishing\n",
    "   - Keep tasks `in_progress` if blocked or encountering errors\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Task Completion Rules:**\n",
    "   - ONLY mark as `completed` when FULLY accomplished\n",
    "   - Never mark complete if tests are failing, implementation is partial, or errors are unresolved\n",
    "   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Task Organization:**\n",
    "   - Create specific, actionable items\n",
    "   - Break complex tasks into manageable steps\n",
    "   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n",
    "   - Remove irrelevant tasks entirely (don't just mark cancelled)\n",

    "### ToolPermission System\n",
    "\n",
    "Three permission levels:\n",

    "- **NEVER**: Tool is permanently disabled\n",
    "- **ASK**: User must approve each execution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Permission Check Flow**:\n",
    "1. Tool calls `check_allowlist_denylist(args)`\n",

    "\n",
    "Provides execution context:\n",
    "- `tool_call_id`: Unique identifier for this invocation\n",

    "## Mistral Vibe Tool System: Comprehensive Security Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "I've completed an in-depth exploration of Mistral Vibe's tool system, documenting each built-in tool, its security mechanisms, and the overall architecture. Here's a comprehensive summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in Tools Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Mistral Vibe provides 8 built-in tools, each with sophisticated security mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **read_file** - Safe file reading with byte limits and path validation\n",
    "2. **write_file** - Protected file writing with overwrite confirmation\n",
    "3. **search_replace** - Precise file editing with backup support\n",
    "4. **bash** - Secure command execution with allowlist/denylist and process isolation\n",
    "5. **grep** - Safe code searching with exclusion patterns\n",
    "6. **todo** - Task management with state isolation\n",
    "7. **ask_user_question** - Interactive user queries with context validation\n",
    "8. **task** - Subagent delegation with agent type validation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Security Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Path Security**\n",
    "- All tools validate paths are within the project directory using `path.relative_to()`\n",
    "- Prevents directory traversal attacks\n",
    "- Expands and resolves paths consistently\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Permission System**\n",
    "- Three-level permission model: ALWAYS, NEVER, ASK\n",
    "- Allowlist/denylist patterns using `fnmatch`\n",
    "- Configurable per-tool permissions\n",
    "- Explicit user approval for most operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Resource Limits**\n",
    "- Byte limits for file operations (64KB-100KB)\n",
    "- Output limits for commands (16KB-64KB)\n",
    "- Match limits for searches (100 matches)\n",
    "- Timeout enforcement (60-300 seconds)\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Process Isolation**\n",
    "- Bash commands run in isolated process groups\n",
    "- Safe environment variables (CI=true, NONINTERACTIVE=1)\n",
    "- Process tree killing on timeout\n",
    "- Platform-specific handling (Windows vs Unix)\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Input Validation**\n",
    "- Pydantic model validation for all parameters\n",
    "- Strict type checking and constraints\n",
    "- Parameter range validation\n",
    "- Empty/null checking\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Error Handling**\n",
    "- Graceful error recovery\n",
    "- Detailed error messages with context\n",
    "- Wrapping of low-level errors\n",
    "- Prevention of information leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool system implements a **defense-in-depth** approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **BaseTool Framework** - Provides type safety, configuration, and state management\n",
    "2. **Permission System** - Three-tier approval model with allowlist/denylist\n",
    "3. **InvokeContext** - Execution context with approval callbacks\n",
    "4. **ToolManager** - Centralized tool discovery and instantiation\n",
    "5. **Agent Loop** - Orchestrates tool execution with middleware\n",
    "\n",
    "### Most Important Security Aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "**Path Containment**: The most critical security feature is path validation. All file operations check that paths remain within the project directory using `path.relative_to(Path.cwd().resolve())`, preventing directory traversal attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process Isolation**: For command execution, the system uses tree-sitter to parse commands, sets safe environment variables, creates isolated process groups, and enforces strict timeouts to prevent command injection and resource exhaustion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Permission Model**: The three-level permission system (ALWAYS/NEVER/ASK) with allowlist/denylist support provides fine-grained control over tool execution, requiring explicit user approval for most operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resource Limits**: Byte limits, output limits, and timeouts prevent resource exhaustion attacks, ensuring the system remains responsive even with malicious input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation file `mistral-vibe-tool-system-analysis.md` provides a detailed, comprehensive analysis of each tool's security mechanisms, input/output signatures, and implementation details."

    "### Key Integration Points\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`get_universal_system_prompt()`** - Builds the complete system prompt\n",
    "2. **`BaseTool.get_tool_prompt()`** - Loads tool-specific documentation\n",
    "3. **`APIToolFormatHandler.get_available_tools()`** - Provides tool schemas to LLM\n",
    "4. **`ToolManager`** - Discovers and manages available tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool Execution Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. LLM receives system prompt + tool schemas\n",
    "2. LLM generates tool calls in API format\n",
    "3. `parse_message()` extracts tool calls\n",
    "4. `resolve_tool_calls()` validates tool names and arguments\n",
    "5. Agent loop executes tools with permission checks\n",
    "6. Results are formatted and added to conversation\n",

    "- **`run(args, ctx)`**: Abstract method that tools must implement\n",
    "  - Takes input arguments and optional context\n",
    "  - Returns an AsyncGenerator yielding ToolStreamEvent or ToolResult\n",
    "  - This is where the actual tool logic goes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`invoke(ctx, **raw)`**: Validates arguments and runs the tool\n",
    "  - Validates input using Pydantic\n",
    "  - Handles errors gracefully\n",
    "  - Yields results from the run method\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`from_config(config)`**: Factory method to create tool instances\n",
    "  - Creates initial state and returns configured tool instance\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Utility Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`get_tool_prompt()`**: Loads the tool's prompt file (from prompts/ subdirectory)\n",
    "- **`get_name()`**: Returns the tool name in snake_case format\n",
    "- **`get_parameters()`**: Returns JSON schema for the tool's arguments\n",
    "- **`check_allowlist_denylist()`**: Checks if arguments match allowlist/denylist (can be overridden)\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Type Extraction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`_get_tool_config_class()`**: Extracts ToolConfig type from class hierarchy\n",
    "- **`_get_tool_state_class()`**: Extracts ToolState type from class hierarchy\n",
    "- **`_get_tool_args_results()`**: Extracts ToolArgs and ToolResult types from run method signature\n",
    "- **`_extract_result_type()`**: Extracts ToolResult from AsyncGenerator return type\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generic Base Class**: Uses Python generics to ensure type safety while allowing customization\n",
    "2. **Pydantic Validation**: All arguments, results, config, and state use Pydantic models for validation\n",
    "3. **Async Streaming**: Tools yield results asynchronously for better UX\n",
    "4. **Dependency Injection**: Configuration and state are injected at creation time\n",
    "5. **Type Introspection**: Extracts types from method signatures for runtime validation\n",
    "\n",
    "The BaseTool class provides a solid foundation for creating type-safe, validated tools with consistent behavior across the system."

    "### 1. Configuration Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP servers are configured in the VibeConfig with three types:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "MCPServer = Annotated[\n",
    "    MCPHttp | MCPStreamableHttp | MCPStdio,\n",
    "    Field(discriminator=\"transport\")\n",

    "Each MCP server has:\n",
    "- **`name`**: Short alias used to prefix tool names\n",
    "- **`prompt`**: Optional usage hint\n",
    "- **`startup_timeout_sec`**: Timeout for server initialization (default: 10s)\n",
    "- **`tool_timeout_sec`**: Timeout for tool execution (default: 60s)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transport Types:**\n",
    "- **HTTP**: Remote servers accessed via HTTP\n",
    "  - `url`: Base URL\n",
    "  - `headers`: Additional HTTP headers\n",
    "  - `api_key_env`: Environment variable for API token\n",
    "  - `api_key_header`: HTTP header for the token\n",
    "  - `api_key_format`: Format string for header value\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Streamable HTTP**: Similar to HTTP but with streaming support\n",
    "  - Same fields as HTTP\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stdio**: Local servers run as subprocesses\n",
    "  - `command`: Command to run (string or list)\n",
    "  - `args`: Additional arguments\n",
    "  - `env`: Environment variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Discovery Process\n",

    "**For HTTP/Streamable HTTP servers:**\n",
    "1. Connect to the server URL with optional headers\n",

    "- Provides custom display methods for UI integration\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Tool Execution Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "When an MCP proxy tool is invoked:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Argument Validation**: Input is validated against the remote tool's schema\n",
    "2. **Connection Setup**: HTTP connection or stdio subprocess is established\n",
    "3. **Tool Call**: The remote tool is called with the provided arguments\n",
    "4. **Result Parsing**: The MCP response is parsed into `MCPToolResult`\n",
    "5. **Result Yielding**: The result is yielded as an async generator\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Result Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MCPToolResult` model contains:\n",
    "- `ok`: Boolean indicating success\n",
    "- `server`: Server identifier (URL or command)\n",
    "- `tool`: Tool name\n",
    "- `text`: Text content (if any)\n",
    "- `structured`: Structured content (if any)\n",
    "\n",
    "Results are displayed in the UI with custom `get_call_display()` and `get_result_display()` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "- Connection timeouts are handled via `startup_timeout_sec` and `tool_timeout_sec`\n",
    "- Failed calls raise `ToolError` with descriptive messages\n",
    "- Discovery failures are logged but don't crash the system\n",
    "- Individual tool registration failures are logged and skipped\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Integration Points\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP tools are fully integrated into the tool system:\n",
    "- Discovered tools are added to `ToolManager._available`\n",
    "- Can be enabled/disabled via `enabled_tools`/`disabled_tools` config\n",
    "- Respect the same permission model as built-in tools\n",
    "- Use the same configuration and state management\n",
    "- Appear in tool listings and autocompletion\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture allows seamless integration of external MCP servers as first-class tools in the Vibe system, with proper type safety, error handling, and UI integration."

    "}\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Implementation Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture allows for web search to be enabled by:\n",
    "1. Adding provider-specific headers through the `extra_headers` parameter\n",
    "2. These headers are passed to the backend (GenericBackend or MistralBackend)\n",
    "3. The backend includes them in the HTTP request to the provider\n",
    "4. The provider handles the web search internally and returns results\n",
    "\n",
    "This mechanism provides a clean way to enable provider-specific capabilities like web search without modifying the core tool system."

    "\n",
    "**Agents** are the main entities that interact with users and execute tasks. Each agent has a profile that defines its behavior, safety level, and tool permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Profile Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "An agent profile consists of:\n",
    "- **Name**: Unique identifier for the agent\n",
    "- **Display Name**: Human-readable name\n",
    "- **Description**: What the agent does\n",
    "- **Safety Level**: One of SAFE, NEUTRAL, DESTRUCTIVE, or YOLO\n",
    "- **Agent Type**: AGENT (primary) or SUBAGENT (for delegation)\n",
    "- **Overrides**: Configuration overrides (tools, permissions, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Mistral Vibe comes with several built-in agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`default`** - Standard agent requiring approval for tool executions\n",
    "2. **`plan`** - Read-only agent for exploration and planning (auto-approves safe tools)\n",
    "3. **`accept-edits`** - Auto-approves file edits only\n",
    "4. **`auto-approve`** - Auto-approves all tool executions (use with caution)\n",
    "5. **`explore`** - Read-only subagent for codebase exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Safety Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SAFE**: Read-only operations, no destructive actions\n",
    "- **NEUTRAL**: Default level, requires approval for most actions\n",
    "- **DESTRUCTIVE**: Can modify files but with restrictions\n",
    "- **YOLO**: No restrictions, auto-approves everything\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "vibe --agent plan\n",
    "vibe --agent auto-approve\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Subagents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subagents** are specialized agents designed for task delegation. They run independently and can perform work without user interaction, preventing context overload.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run in parallel with the main agent\n",
    "- Have their own configuration and tool permissions\n",
    "- Can be invoked using the `task` tool\n",
    "- Useful for long-running or specialized tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Delegating to a Subagent\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> Can you explore the codebase structure while I work on something else?\n",
    "\n",
    "🤖 I'll use the task tool to delegate this to the explore subagent.\n",
    "\n",
    "> task(task=\"Analyze the project structure and architecture\", agent=\"explore\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Custom Subagents\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a custom subagent, add `agent_type = \"subagent\"` to your agent configuration:\n",

    "### How They Work Together\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent** defines which tools are available and their permissions\n",
    "2. **Skills** can add new tools or modify behavior (experimental)\n",
    "3. **Tools** are the actual implementations that perform actions\n",
    "4. **Subagents** are specialized agents that can be delegated to\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tool can have different permission levels:\n",
    "- **always**: Auto-approved, no user confirmation\n",
    "- **never**: Disabled for this agent\n",
    "- **ask**: Requires user approval (default)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example agent configuration with tool permissions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```toml\n",
    "[tools.write_file]\n",
    "permission = \"always\"\n",
    "\n",
    "[tools.bash]\n",

    "### Configuration File Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The main configuration file (`config.toml`) controls:\n",

    "1. **Global Settings**: Model, theme, behavior\n",
    "2. **Agent Management**: Paths, enable/disable patterns\n",
    "3. **Skill Management**: Paths, enable/disable patterns\n",
    "4. **Tool Management**: Paths, enable/disable patterns, permissions\n",

    "6. **Session Management**: Logging, save directory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuration follows this inheritance order (later overrides earlier):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Default values (built into Vibe)\n",
    "2. Global config (`~/.vibe/config.toml`)\n",
    "3. Project config (`.vibe/config.toml`)\n",
    "4. Agent-specific overrides (from agent profile)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "Vibe supports three types of patterns for enabling/disabling agents, skills, and tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exact names**: `\"default\"` matches only \"default\"\n",
    "2. **Glob patterns**: `\"test-*\"` matches \"test-1\", \"test-2\", etc.\n",
    "3. **Regex patterns**: `\"re:^serena_.*$\"` matches regex pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agents** are the main entities that interact with users\n",
    "- **Subagents** are specialized agents for task delegation\n",
    "- **Skills** extend functionality through reusable components\n",
    "- **Tools** are the actual implementations that perform actions\n",
    "- **All can be customized** through configuration files and Python code\n",
    "- **Configuration** controls which agents, skills, and tools are available\n",

    "## Built-in Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Mistral Vibe comes with several built-in prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`cli`** - The default system prompt for CLI interactions (see `vibe/core/prompts/cli.md`)\n",
    "   - Focuses on tool usage, code modifications, and professional objectivity\n",
    "   - Designed for coding assistance in a terminal environment\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`tests`** - A minimal test prompt (see `vibe/core/prompts/tests.md`)\n",
    "   - Simple prompt for testing purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Utility Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`compact`** - Prompt for creating conversation summaries (see `vibe/core/prompts/compact.md`)\n",
    "   - Used when the conversation needs to be compacted\n",
    "   - Requires specific structure with 7 sections\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`project_context`** - Template for project context information (see `vibe/core/prompts/project_context.md`)\n",
    "   - Displays directory structure and git status\n",
    "   - Used to provide project-aware context\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`dangerous_directory`** - Warning for dangerous directories (see `vibe/core/prompts/dangerous_directory.md`)\n",
    "   - Shown when scanning is disabled for security reasons\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Prompt Customization\n",
    "\n",
    "The system prompt is the foundation of the agent's behavior and can be fully customized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 1: Using Built-in Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply set the `system_prompt_id` in your configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```toml\n",
    "# ~/.vibe/config.toml\n",
    "system_prompt_id = \"cli\"  # or \"tests\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 2: Creating Custom System Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create your own system prompts by placing markdown files in the prompts directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a prompts directory** (if it doesn't exist):\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   mkdir -p ~/.vibe/prompts\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a markdown file** with your custom prompt:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   nano ~/.vibe/prompts/my-custom-prompt.md\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define your prompt** in the markdown file:\n",
    "   ```markdown\n",
    "   # My Custom Prompt\n",
    "   \n",
    "   You are a helpful coding assistant specialized in [your domain].\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ## Guidelines\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Always be helpful and friendly\n",
    "   - Focus on [specific requirements]\n",
    "   - Avoid [certain behaviors]\n",
    "   - Prefer [specific approaches]\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ## Tool Usage\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Use tools to fulfill requests\n",
    "   - Always check parameters before using tools\n",
    "   - Match the existing code style\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Activate your custom prompt** in config:\n",
    "   ```toml\n",
    "   # ~/.vibe/config.toml\n",
    "   system_prompt_id = \"my-custom-prompt\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project-Specific Custom Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create prompts specific to a project:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir -p .vibe/prompts\n",
    "nano .vibe/prompts/project-prompt.md\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then reference it:\n",
    "```toml\n",
    "# .vibe/config.toml\n",
    "system_prompt_id = \"project-prompt\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt Discovery Order\n",
    "\n",
    "Vibe looks for custom prompts in this order:\n",
    "1. **Project-specific prompts**: `.vibe/prompts/[name].md`\n",
    "2. **Global prompts**: `~/.vibe/prompts/[name].md`\n",
    "3. **Built-in prompts**: `vibe/core/prompts/[name].md`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Utility Prompt Customization\n",
    "\n",
    "Utility prompts are used for specific contextual information and can also be customized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Customizing Project Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The project context template (`project_context.md`) can be customized:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a custom template**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   nano ~/.vibe/prompts/project_context.md\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Modify the template** with your preferred format:\n",
    "   ```markdown\n",
    "   directoryStructure: Below is a snapshot of {abs_path} at the start of the conversation.{large_repo_warning}\n",
    "\n",
    "{structure}\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolute path: {abs_path}\n",
    "\n",
    "gitStatus: This is the git status at the start of the conversation.\n",
    "{git_status}\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Context:\n",
    "- Current timestamp: {timestamp}\n",
    "- User: {username}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Note**: The template uses placeholders that will be replaced at runtime:\n",
    "   - `{large_repo_warning}` - Warning if repository is large\n",
    "   - `{structure}` - Directory structure\n",
    "   - `{abs_path}` - Absolute path\n",
    "   - `{git_status}` - Git status information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Customizing Dangerous Directory Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "The dangerous directory prompt can also be customized:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "nano ~/.vibe/prompts/dangerous_directory.md\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example custom version:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "⚠️  Security Restriction Active ⚠️\n",
    "\n",
    "Project context scanning has been disabled because {reason}.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is for your security. You can still use tools to explore the project:\n",
    "- Use `read_file` to read specific files\n",
    "- Use `bash` to run commands\n",
    "- Use `grep` to search for patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolute path: {abs_path}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Context Customization\n",
    "\n",
    "The project context provides information about the current project and can be extensively customized through configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration Options\n",
    "\n",
    "```toml\n",
    "# ~/.vibe/config.toml\n",
    "\n",
    "[project_context]\n",
    "# Maximum characters in directory structure\n",
    "max_chars = 40000\n",
    "\n",
    "# Default number of commits to show in git status\n",
    "default_commit_count = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "# Maximum size of documentation files to load\n",
    "max_doc_bytes = 32768\n",
    "\n",
    "# Buffer for truncation warnings\n",
    "truncation_buffer = 1000\n",
    "\n",
    "# Maximum depth for directory traversal\n",
    "max_depth = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Maximum number of files to show\n",
    "max_files = 1000\n",
    "\n",
    "# Maximum directories per level\n",
    "max_dirs_per_level = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "# Timeout for git operations (seconds)\n",
    "timeout_seconds = 2.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Customizing Project Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Vibe automatically loads documentation from these files in the project root:\n",
    "- `README.md`\n",
    "- `README.rst`\n",
    "- `README.txt`\n",
    "- `README.markdown`\n",
    "- `README`\n",
    "- `readme.md`\n",
    "- `readme.rst`\n",
    "- `readme.txt`\n",
    "- `readme.markdown`\n",
    "- `readme`\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation is loaded with a size limit (default: 32KB) and displayed in the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disabling Project Context\n",
    "\n",
    "You can disable project context entirely:\n",
    "\n",
    "```toml\n",
    "# ~/.vibe/config.toml\n",
    "include_project_context = false\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Session-Specific Prompt Control\n",
    "\n",
    "You can control which prompt layers are included in each session through configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Available Configuration Options\n",
    "\n",
    "```toml\n",
    "# ~/.vibe/config.toml\n",
    "\n",
    "# Include commit signature instructions\n",
    "include_commit_signature = true\n",
    "\n",
    "# Include model information\n",
    "include_model_info = true\n",
    "\n",
    "# Include OS and shell information\n",
    "include_prompt_detail = true\n",
    "\n",
    "# Include project context\n",
    "include_project_context = true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Minimal Prompt Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "```toml\n",
    "# ~/.vibe/config.toml\n",
    "include_commit_signature = false\n",
    "include_model_info = false\n",
    "include_prompt_detail = false\n",
    "include_project_context = false\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This would result in just the base system prompt being sent to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Full Context Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "```toml\n",
    "# ~/.vibe/config.toml\n",
    "include_commit_signature = true\n",
    "include_model_info = true\n",
    "include_prompt_detail = true\n",
    "include_project_context = true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This would include all available context layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Prompt Customization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent-Specific Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "You can override the system prompt for specific agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "```toml\n",
    "# ~/.vibe/agents/reviewer.toml\n",
    "name = \"reviewer\"\n",
    "display_name = \"Code Reviewer\"\n",
    "system_prompt_id = \"review-prompt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "[tools.read_file]\n",
    "permission = \"always\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then create the custom prompt:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "nano ~/.vibe/prompts/review-prompt.md\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Prompt Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "While Vibe doesn't support dynamic prompt selection based on runtime conditions out of the box, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create multiple prompts** and switch between them using different agents\n",
    "2. **Use environment variables** in your prompts (though they won't be expanded automatically)\n",
    "3. **Use MCP servers** to provide dynamic context through tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom Tool Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tool can have its own prompt. To customize tool prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a custom tool** in `~/.vibe/tools/`\n",
    "2. **Override the `get_tool_prompt()` method**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ~/.vibe/tools/my_tool.py\n",
    "from vibe.core.tools.base import BaseTool, BaseToolConfig\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyTool(BaseTool[BaseToolConfig]):\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def get_name(cls) -> str:\n",
    "        return \"my_tool\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def get_description(cls) -> str:\n",
    "        return \"My custom tool\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def get_tool_prompt(cls) -> str:\n",
    "        \"\"\"Custom prompt for this tool.\"\"\"\n",
    "        return \"\"\"\n",
    "# My Tool Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "When using my_tool, always:\n",
    "- Provide the my_option parameter\n",
    "- Use lowercase values\n",
    "- Check the result before proceeding\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    async def run(self) -> str:\n",
    "        return \"Tool executed\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prompt Variables and Dynamic Content\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt system supports several dynamic variables that are replaced at runtime:\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Prompt Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- `{config.active_model}` - The currently active model name\n",
    "- `{config.textual_theme}` - The current UI theme\n",
    "- `{platform}` - Operating system platform\n",
    "- `{shell}` - Default shell\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Context Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- `{large_repo_warning}` - Warning if repository is large\n",
    "- `{structure}` - Directory structure tree\n",
    "- `{abs_path}` - Absolute path to project root\n",
    "- `{git_status}` - Git repository status\n",
    "\n",
    "### Git Status Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Current branch` - Name of current git branch\n",
    "- `Main branch` - Name of main branch (main or master)\n",
    "- `Status` - Repository status (clean or number of changes)\n",
    "- `Recent commits` - List of recent commits\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Content Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Some content is generated dynamically:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Directory Structure** - Built from actual filesystem\n",
    "2. **Git Status** - Fetched from git commands\n",
    "3. **Available Skills** - List of loaded skills\n",
    "4. **Available Subagents** - List of available subagents\n",
    "5. **Tool Prompts** - Prompts from each available tool\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices for Prompt Customization\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Start with the Built-in Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by using the built-in `cli` prompt and make incremental changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cp vibe/core/prompts/cli.md ~/.vibe/prompts/my-prompt.md\n",
    "nano ~/.vibe/prompts/my-prompt.md\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Keep Prompts Concise\n",
    "\n",
    "- The LLM has token limits, so keep prompts focused\n",
    "- Remove guidelines that aren't essential for your use case\n",
    "- Avoid redundant information\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Be Specific About Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have specific requirements, state them clearly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "## Domain-Specific Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always use TypeScript for frontend code\n",
    "- Prefer functional components over class components\n",
    "- Use the @mui/material library for UI components\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Test Incrementally\n",
    "\n",
    "Make small changes and test them before making larger modifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "```toml\n",
    "system_prompt_id = \"test-v1\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Test, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "```toml\n",
    "system_prompt_id = \"test-v2\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Document Your Custom Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Add comments to explain why certain guidelines exist:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "## Code Style Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use 2-space indentation (company standard)\n",
    "- Prefer const over let (immutability best practice)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Consider Context Length\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the prompt is combined with:\n",
    "- Conversation history\n",
    "- Previous tool outputs\n",
    "- Current user message\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep the total under the model's context window limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Use Multiple Prompts for Different Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Create different prompts for different scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# For code reviews\n",
    "nano ~/.vibe/prompts/review.md\n",
    "\n",
    "# For documentation\n",
    "nano ~/.vibe/prompts/docs.md\n",
    "\n",
    "# For testing\n",
    "nano ~/.vibe/prompts/test.md\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then use different agents for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "```toml\n",
    "# ~/.vibe/agents/reviewer.toml\n",

    "## How the Task Tool Works in Mistral Vibe\n",
    "\n",
    "I've explored the task tool implementation and created a detailed document covering all aspects. Here's what I found:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Core Functionality**\n",
    "The `task` tool delegates work to subagents for independent execution, enabling:\n",
    "- Context management (offload work to prevent context overload)\n",
    "- Parallel execution (run multiple tasks independently)\n",
    "- Specialization (use different subagents for different tasks)\n",
    "- Automation (delegate repetitive or complex tasks)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Validation**: Checks that the specified agent exists and is a subagent\n",
    "2. **Isolated Execution**: Creates a new `AgentLoop` with logging disabled\n",
    "3. **Conversation Loop**: Runs the subagent with the task description\n",
    "4. **Event Streaming**: Collects responses and displays tool results\n",
    "5. **Completion**: Returns accumulated response with turn count\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Security Mechanisms**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent Type Validation**: Only subagents can be spawned (prevents recursion)\n",
    "- **Isolated Configuration**: Session logging disabled for privacy\n",
    "- **Inherited Approval Callback**: Maintains same permission model\n",
    "- **Turn Counting**: Prevents runaway processes\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation on failures\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task Arguments**\n",
    "- **Required**: `task` (str) - The task description\n",
    "- **Optional**: `agent` (str) - Subagent name (default: \"explore\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task Results**\n",
    "Returns a `TaskResult` with:\n",
    "- `response`: Accumulated text response\n",
    "- `turns_used`: Number of assistant responses\n",
    "- `completed`: Whether task finished normally\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Best Practices**\n",
    "- Write clear, detailed task descriptions\n",
    "- Choose the right subagent for the task\n",
    "- Use for complex tasks, not simple operations\n",
    "- Trust subagent autonomy\n",

    "## Overview of the Task Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "The `task` tool is a powerful feature in Mistral Vibe that allows delegating work to subagents for independent execution. It enables parallel processing and context management by running specialized agents in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Independent Execution**: Subagents run autonomously without user interaction\n",
    "- **Context Isolation**: Subagent conversations don't interfere with the main conversation\n",
    "- **Resource Management**: Limits on turns and execution to prevent runaway processes\n",
    "- **Security Constraints**: Only subagents can be spawned (not regular agents)\n",
    "- **No Logging**: Subagent interactions are not saved to session logs\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the Task Tool Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The task tool creates a separate `AgentLoop` instance for the subagent, runs it with the provided task description, and returns the accumulated results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Validation**: Check that the specified agent exists and is a subagent\n",
    "2. **Configuration**: Create a new configuration with logging disabled\n",
    "3. **Execution**: Run the subagent's conversation loop with the task\n",
    "4. **Monitoring**: Track turns and collect output\n",
    "5. **Completion**: Return results when done or interrupted\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. Get the subagent profile\n",
    "agent_profile = agent_manager.get_agent(args.agent)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Validate it's a subagent\n",
    "if agent_profile.agent_type != AgentType.SUBAGENT:\n",
    "    raise ToolError(\"Only subagents can be used\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Create isolated configuration\n",

    "    completed=completed,\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Execution Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tool Invocation**\n",
    "   - User or main agent calls `task(task=\"...\", agent=\"...\")`\n",
    "   - Tool is validated and permissions are checked\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Subagent Selection**\n",
    "   - Agent manager looks up the specified agent\n",
    "   - Verifies it's a subagent (not a regular agent)\n",
    "   - Loads the agent's profile and configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Isolated Execution Environment**\n",
    "   - Creates new `AgentLoop` instance for the subagent\n",
    "   - Disables session logging (`SessionLoggingConfig(enabled=False)`)\n",
    "   - Inherits approval callback from parent context\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conversation Loop**\n",
    "   - Subagent processes the task description\n",
    "   - Can use any tools allowed in its profile\n",
    "   - Generates responses and tool calls\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Event Streaming**\n",
    "   - Assistant messages are collected\n",
    "   - Tool results are displayed in real-time\n",
    "   - Interruptions are detected\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Completion**\n",
    "   - Counts turns used (number of assistant responses)\n",
    "   - Determines if task completed normally\n",
    "   - Returns accumulated response\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event Types Handled\n",
    "\n",
    "The task tool processes these event types from the subagent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AssistantEvent**: Collects the subagent's text responses\n",
    "- **ToolResultEvent**: Displays tool execution results\n",
    "- **CompactStartEvent/CompactEndEvent**: Handles conversation compaction\n",
    "- **Middleware stop events**: Detects interruptions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "The task tool accepts two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`task`** (str): The task description to delegate to the subagent\n",
    "  - Should be clear and detailed\n",
    "  - Provides context for autonomous execution\n",
    "  - Examples: \"Analyze the project structure\", \"Find all TODO comments\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`agent`** (str): Name of the subagent to use\n",
    "  - Default: \"explore\" (built-in exploration subagent)\n",
    "  - Must be a valid subagent profile\n",
    "  - Examples: \"explore\", \"my-custom-subagent\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Invocations\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "task(task=\"Find all instances of the word TODO in the codebase\")\n",
    "task(task=\"Analyze the architecture of the backend service\", agent=\"explore\")\n",
    "task(task=\"Review the test files for missing assertions\", agent=\"reviewer\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The task tool returns a `TaskResult` object with three fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Result Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`response`** (str): Accumulated text response from the subagent\n",
    "   - Contains all assistant messages concatenated\n",
    "   - May include error messages if execution failed\n",
    "   - Used as the primary output of the tool\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`turns_used`** (int): Number of turns the subagent used\n",
    "   - Counts assistant responses in the conversation\n",
    "   - Helps track resource usage\n",
    "   - Used for monitoring and billing\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`completed`** (bool): Whether the task completed normally\n",
    "   - `True` if subagent finished naturally\n",
    "   - `False` if interrupted by middleware or error\n",
    "   - Helps determine if results are reliable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Successful completion:**\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"response\": \"Found 15 TODO comments in the codebase...\",\n",
    "  \"turns_used\": 3,\n",
    "  \"completed\": true\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interrupted:**\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"response\": \"Analyzing project structure... [Subagent error: timeout]\",\n",
    "  \"turns_used\": 5,\n",
    "  \"completed\": false\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security and Safety Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "The task tool has multiple security layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Agent Type Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if agent_profile.agent_type != AgentType.SUBAGENT:\n",
    "    raise ToolError(\n",
    "        f\"Agent '{args.agent}' is a {agent_profile.agent_type.value} agent. \"\n",
    "        f\"Only subagents can be used with the task tool. \"\n",
    "        f\"This is a security constraint to prevent recursive spawning.\"\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Prevents infinite recursion by ensuring only subagents can be spawned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Isolated Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "base_config = VibeConfig.load(\n",
    "    session_logging=SessionLoggingConfig(enabled=False)\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Subagent interactions are not logged to prevent sensitive data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Inherited Approval Callback\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if ctx and ctx.approval_callback:\n",
    "    subagent_loop.set_approval_callback(ctx.approval_callback)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Maintains the same permission model as the parent agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Turn Counting\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "turns_used = sum(\n",
    "    msg.role == Role.assistant for msg in subagent_loop.messages\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Prevents runaway processes by tracking resource usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    async for event in subagent_loop.act(args.task):\n",
    "        # ... process events\n",
    "        \n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    completed = False\n",
    "    accumulated_response.append(f\"\\n[Subagent error: {e}]\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Graceful handling of subagent failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Middleware Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "The subagent inherits middleware from the main configuration:\n",
    "- **TurnLimitMiddleware**: Limits number of turns\n",
    "- **PriceLimitMiddleware**: Limits cost\n",
    "- **AutoCompactMiddleware**: Compacts long conversations\n",
    "- **PlanAgentMiddleware**: Handles plan agent logic\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use the Task Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Context management**: Delegate tasks that would consume too much main conversation context\n",
    "✅ **Specialized work**: Use appropriate subagents for specific task types\n",
    "✅ **Parallel execution**: Launch multiple subagents for independent tasks\n",
    "✅ **Autonomous work**: Tasks that don't require back-and-forth with the user\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Write clear, detailed task descriptions**\n",
    "   - The subagent works autonomously\n",
    "   - Provide enough context for independent success\n",
    "   - Example: \"Analyze the project structure and architecture\" vs \"Check stuff\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Choose the right subagent**\n",
    "   - Match the subagent to the task type\n",
    "   - Use built-in subagents like \"explore\" for code analysis\n",
    "   - Create custom subagents for specialized tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prefer direct tools for simple operations**\n",
    "   - If you know exactly which file to read: use `read_file`\n",
    "   - If you need to search: use `grep`\n",
    "   - Only use task for complex, multi-step work\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Trust the subagent's judgment**\n",
    "   - Let it explore without micromanaging\n",
    "   - Avoid specifying exact steps\n",
    "   - Focus on the goal, not the method\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "**Codebase Exploration:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "task(task=\"Analyze the project structure and identify key components\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern Searching:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "task(task=\"Find all deprecated API usages in the codebase\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Documentation Review:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "task(task=\"Check if all public functions have proper documentation\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture Analysis:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "task(task=\"Analyze the database schema and identify potential issues\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No file writing**: Subagents cannot write or modify files\n",
    "- **No user interaction**: Subagents cannot ask user questions\n",
    "- **No persistent state**: Subagent sessions are not saved\n",
    "- **Limited turns**: Controlled by middleware (turn limits)\n",
    "- **Cost limits**: Controlled by middleware (price limits)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single subagent at a time**: Only one subagent runs per task call\n",
    "- **No nested tasks**: Subagents cannot call the task tool themselves\n",
    "- **Resource sharing**: Subagents share the same LLM backend\n",
    "- **Context isolation**: Subagent context doesn't affect main conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Timeouts**: Subagents may be interrupted if they take too long\n",
    "- **Resource limits**: Subagents are constrained by middleware\n",
    "- **Permission errors**: Subagents respect their tool permissions\n",
    "- **Execution errors**: Errors are captured and returned in response\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool Class Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Task(\n",

    "The skills system in Mistral Vibe allows extending functionality through reusable components. Skills can add specialized behaviors, documentation, and can appear as slash commands in the UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reusable Components**: Skills are self-contained units of functionality\n",
    "- **Metadata-Driven**: Skills use YAML frontmatter for configuration\n",
    "- **Discoverable**: Skills are automatically discovered from multiple paths\n",
    "- **Configurable**: Skills can be enabled/disabled via patterns\n",
    "- **User-Invocable**: Skills can appear in slash command menu\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Skills serve several purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Documentation**: Provide context about available capabilities\n",
    "2. **Specialization**: Define specialized behaviors for different domains\n",
    "3. **Slash Commands**: Appear as user-invocable commands in the UI\n",
    "4. **Tool Restrictions**: Limit which tools a skill can use (experimental)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Skill Structure and Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Skills are defined in directories with a `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter followed by markdown content.\n",

    "## Skill Management and Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enabling and Disabling Skills\n",
    "\n",
    "Skills can be enabled or disabled using patterns in configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```toml\n",
    "# ~/.vibe/config.toml\n",
    "\n",
    "# Enable specific skills\n",
    "enabled_skills = [\"code-review\", \"test-*\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Disable specific skills\n",
    "disabled_skills = [\"experimental-*\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "Vibe supports three types of patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exact names**: `\"code-review\"` matches only \"code-review\"\n",
    "2. **Glob patterns**: `\"test-*\"` matches \"test-1\", \"test-2\", etc.\n",
    "3. **Regex patterns**: `\"re:^serena_.*$\"` matches regex pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@property\n",
    "def available_skills(self) -> dict[str, SkillInfo]:\n",
    "    if self._config.enabled_skills:\n",
    "        return {\n",
    "            name: info\n",
    "            for name, info in self._available.items()\n",
    "            if name_matches(name, self._config.enabled_skills)\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    if self._config.disabled_skills:\n",
    "        return {\n",
    "            name: info\n",
    "            for name, info in self._available.items()\n",
    "            if not name_matches(name, self._config.disabled_skills)\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    return dict(self._available)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Priority Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- If `enabled_skills` is set: Only those skills are available\n",
    "- If `disabled_skills` is set (and `enabled_skills` not set): All skills except disabled ones\n",
    "- If neither is set: All discovered skills are available\n",
    "\n",
    "## Skills and Slash Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Skills can appear as slash commands in the UI when `user_invocable` is `true`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User-Invocable Skills\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "When a skill is user-invocable, it appears in the slash command menu as:\n",
    "`/skill-name` or `/skill name` (spaces replaced with hyphens)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Invocation Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user invokes a skill via slash command:\n",
    "1. The skill's `SKILL.md` file is read\n",
    "2. The description and instructions are displayed\n",
    "3. The agent can use the skill's allowed tools\n",
    "4. The skill's context is included in the conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices for Creating Skills\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Clear and Descriptive Names\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use lowercase with hyphens: `code-review`, `test-generator`\n",
    "- Be specific about the skill's purpose\n",
    "- Avoid generic names like `helper` or `assistant`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Comprehensive Descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain what the skill does\n",
    "- Include when to use it\n",
    "- Mention any prerequisites or requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Detailed Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide clear instructions in the markdown body\n",
    "- Include examples of usage\n",
    "- Document any limitations or constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Appropriate Tool Restrictions\n",
    "\n",
    "- List only the tools needed for the skill\n",
    "- Avoid giving unnecessary permissions\n",
    "- Consider security implications\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Versioning and Compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specify compatibility requirements\n",
    "- Document breaking changes\n",
    "- Consider versioning your skills\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test your skill in different scenarios\n",
    "- Verify it works with the allowed tools\n",
    "- Check that the documentation is clear\n",
    "\n",
